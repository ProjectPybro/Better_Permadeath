# Better_Permadeath
## A simple mod that removes the rescue quotas. 
#### Uploaded to github as you can no longer upload mods to ATZ

This stops the player from getting essentially soft-locked in permadeath mode as they cannot reach the quota so they are forced to concede the level, but they still get stuck with the same bad team composition for the next level.

This kinda breaks the medal system. Every level now takes 60 rescues for silver, and 120 rescues for gold, which is the same in the base game. However the first 5 levels, which normally have a reduced quota for medals, are also stuck at this 60 silver 120 gold value. This means getting medals in the first 5 levels is significantly harder, but sadly there's no real way around this.

Note: You still need to activate the permadeath modifier as normal. You can still use this mod without permadeath if you want.
